Cactus Cowboy AR Tech Demo


It's a Cactus Cowboy Spin Off and based on the Fully Loaded source. It's a litte AR Waveshooter. Yes a wave shooter! We all love wave shooters.



Important! READ CAREFULLY IF YOU WANT TO TRY!

In order to get this to work, you need to put your Quest 2 (only Quest 2 supported!) in experimental mode. To do that you need to run an ADB command on your computer.

adb shell setprop debug.oculus.experimentalEnabled 1

More info about this: https://developer.oculus.com/experimental/passthrough-api/

You need to do this every time you reboot your Quest 2 or this feature just won't work and instead of a Passthough AR game you'll end up with a black background app!

Since I was unable to find a Passthrough app, I hereby claim the "First of its kind"-Title!
